Welcome to my page, I'm Andrew DeWitt.
I'm a student of Coding Dojo interested in creating applications or programs related to cryptocurrency and market platforms

I'm learning from the ground up in both realms. History and patterns are my best teachers moving forward.

I'd love to collaborate, my email is DeWittDev@protonmail.ch.
Feel free to reach out at any time.
